## Requirements
* iOS 9.0
* XCode 8
* Swift 3
* Cocoapods

#### Run the app
Install dependencies via Cocoapods (http://cocoapods.org):

```shell
$ pod install
```

Open GiphyClient.xcworkspace, and run the app! ðŸ˜Ž

## Features
* [x] Trending GIFs
* [x] Search GIF by term
* [x] Caching GIFs for fast access
* [x] Add Gifs to your daily story

Implemented this app in MVC, using a Model to handle retrieving JSON for trending and search queries. Images are loaded async as needed, and cached in the model. Upon creating a post, Realm handles persistent storage & retrieval of today's posts, in descending order by date, like a story in Snapchat or Messenger.

## Future Considerations:
* Pagination for search results (currently loads 500 GIFs fairly quickly, so spending time on pagination seemed excessive)
* Error handling (Implemented some error handling and then noticed that it bloated files, for 2 Networking errors / Realm errors to be handled. This would be necessary for a larger project.)
* Unit-testing
